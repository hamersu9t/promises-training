# Promises Training

This repository is designed to provide you with a comprehensive resource to further your understanding and practice of promises in JavaScript. If you're already familiar with promises and want to deepen your knowledge while enhancing your skills, you've come to the right place.

Promises are an integral part of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, allowing you to handle asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread.

In this repository, you'll find a series of texts and exercises (that are accompained by automated tests to check your answers) to help you reinforce your understanding of promises.

However, it is not intended as an introductory guide, so we assume that you have some familiarity with promises.

<!-- Summarize the topics that will be handled -->

Each topic is accompanied by practical exercises that will challenge you to apply your knowledge and reinforce your learning through hands-on practice. The exercises are thoughtfully designed to simulate real-world scenarios, enabling you to develop the skills necessary to tackle complex asynchronous tasks confidently.

To further enhance your learning experience, we have included automated tests for each exercise. These tests will not only evaluate your solution but also provide instant feedback on your performance. By gauging your understanding and progress automatically, you can track your growth and identify areas that may require additional attention.

Happy coding!
